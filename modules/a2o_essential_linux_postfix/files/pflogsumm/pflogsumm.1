\&    There are some issues with the use of --syslog_name.  The problem is
\&    that, even with $syslog_name set, Postfix will sometimes still log
\&    things with "postfix" as the syslog_name.  This is noted in
\&    /etc/postfix/sample-misc.cf:
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        # Beware: a non-default syslog_name setting takes effect only
\&        # after process initialization. Some initialization errors will be
\&        # logged with the default name, especially errors while parsing
\&        # the command line and errors while accessing the Postfix main.cf
\&        # configuration file.

\&    As a consequence, pflogsumm must always look for "postfix," in logs,
\&    as well as whatever is supplied for syslog_name.
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    Where this becomes an issue is where people are running two or more
\&    instances of Postfix, logging to the same file.  In such a case:
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        . Neither instance may use the default "postfix" syslog name
\&          and...
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        . Log entries that fall victim to what's described in
\&          sample-misc.cf will be reported under "postfix", so that if
\&          you're running pflogsumm twice, once for each syslog_name, such
\&          log entries will show up in each report.
