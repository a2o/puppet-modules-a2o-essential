### Set up SSH server as fast as possible
###



###
### 1. Conceptual flow
###
1. Boot Slackware64 CD
2. Setup network (as it should be after the reboot)
3. Set root password
4. Start SSH server (dropbear)
5. STOP! RIGHT THERE, STOP!
   Now go to your workstation and SSH into this server.



###
### 2. Detailed description
###
1.  Put Slackware64 CD in, boot, hit enter three times to get to the command prompt
2.  Network configuration:
2a.  DHCP way:
      -> dhcpcd eth0
2b.  Static network configuration (example):
      -> ifconfig eth0 1.2.3.4 netmask 255.255.255.0
      -> route add default gw 1.2.3.4
      -> echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8 > /etc/resolv.conf"
3.  Execute "passwd" and set new password
4.  Execute "/etc/rc.d/rc.dropbear start"

5.  STOP USING THE MACHINE DIRECTLY RIGHT AWAY!
      Go to your workstation and SSH into the newly booted live OS.
      This will enable you to copy-paste commands etc.
